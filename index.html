    <h2>I hope you like it.</h2>
    <p>During the 1482 Festival of Fools in Paris, Quasimodo, the hunchback of <strong> Notre Dame</strong> , is elected the Pope of Fools for being the ugliest person in Paris. He is hoisted on a throne and paraded around Paris by the jeering mob. </p>
    <p>Pierre Gringoire, a struggling poet and philosopher, tries unsuccessfully to get the crowd to watch his play instead of the parade. </p>
    <p>Archdeacon Claude Frollo appears and stops the parade and orders Quasimodo back to Notre Dame with him. Looking for something to eat, Gringoire admires the graceful beauty of La Esmerelda, a gypsy street dancer, and decides to follow her home.</p>
    <p>After rounding a corner, she is suddenly attacked by Quasimodo and Frollo. Gringoire rushes to help her but is knocked out by Quasimodo as Frollo runs away.</p>
    <p>The King's Archers, led by Phoebus de Chateaupers arrive just in time and capture the hunchback. </p>
    <p>Later that night, a group of beggars and thieves are about to hang Gringoire when La Esmerelda comes forward and offers to save his life by "marrying" him for four years only.</p>
